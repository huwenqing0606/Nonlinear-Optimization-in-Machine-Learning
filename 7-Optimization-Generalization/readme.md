7. Optimization and Generalization

Use the following different tensorflow optimizers to train the MNIST dataset

(1) class AdadeltaOptimizer: Optimizer that implements the Adadelta algorithm.

(2) class AdagradOptimizer: Optimizer that implements the Adagrad algorithm.

(3) class AdamOptimizer: Optimizer that implements the Adam algorithm.

(4) class MomentumOptimizer: Optimizer that implements the Momentum algorithm.

(5) class GradientDescentOptimizer: Optimizer that implements the gradient descent algorithm.

(6) class RMSPropOptimizer: Optimizer that implements the RMSProp algorithm.

The network structure can be built from keras API in tensorflow: you can choose a relatively simple small network. Then compare the training and test errors/accuracy as a function of the training epoches. Experiment on different learning rates and batch sizes.
